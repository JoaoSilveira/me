Today is the grand day, the business is opening its doors! Excitement, expectation, anxiousness among other array of emotions all churn together in your insides. To avoid a dreaded failure, you start to review everything related to your entrepreneurship attempt from the ground up. This way, you could distract as well as prepare yourself for the day. So, bear with me through this brief backstory.

## Background

Since young, woodworking has always been a task that you could immerse yourself in, spending hours and hours without noticing the time flying by. You made your own soapbox car to race your friends, build every sort of "military" gadget to ~~play make-believe~~ defend your homeland with your ~~friends~~ comrades.

But life has gotten you busy since infancy. School demanded more effort than ever, University then, you thought your stomach wouldnâ€™t bear to the end of it. And when not studying, you kept bustling between other activities, not having much time to even actually consider your future and what you want to be and do. You ended up taking an IT degree because it was, and still is, the job of the future.
