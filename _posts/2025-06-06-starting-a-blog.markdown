Today I'm starting the new endeavor of writing a programming blog. For some time I've been waiting to develop a toy system for **P**roduction **P**laning & **C**ontrol (**PPC**), and I figured that a dev log would be a nice place to display the process of developing a new software, the considerations, decisions and planning.

Before I continue rambling about the blog and its development, let me present myself. My name is *João Pedro Silveira*, a computer scientist born in the 90s, Brazilian and fond of music. After graduating in Computer Science from the Western Paraná State University in 2019, I’ve been working as a software developer ever since. I don’t hold myself to a specific position such as front-end developer, I believe computer scientists are too flexible for that. My belief is corroborated by my, albeit short, career. I've worked with front-end, back-end, desktop applications, microservices, database, third party APIs, security cameras and more, and, as you could’ve guessed, several different languages and stacks.

Now that you know a bit about me, let's turn back to the blog. The general outline of this blog will be me going through several iterations of a toy product. Starting very very basic, and then growing a step at a time. I believe this is a more approachable design, at least, much more friendly than writing an amalgamation of tech docs and specifications for an end product then spamming source code.

The blog will definitely not contain the whole source code, as it’s not its purpose, but it will be available on a github repository. The posts will be more about the deliberative part of the development with key highlights of source code.

For now I envision it being a story of a fantastical enterprise that started from the very bottom, and, through arduous work and commitment, has risen to its final glory. I hope this will maintain you entertained until its end, and that you will look warmly at this journey.
